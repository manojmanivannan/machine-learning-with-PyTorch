# Machine Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains my python scripts and notebooks as I learn machine learning and AI using PyTorch (for now). 

## Requirments

Since I used a laptop with GPU ( NVIDIA RTX 3060 ) present, I installed GPU version of PyTorch. Check `requirements.txt`. There is another additional dependency. We need to install GraphViz to be able to use TorchViz, a package that allows us to visualize a modelâ€™s structure. Please check the installation instructions for your OS.

If you are using Windows, please use the installer at GraphViz's Windows Package. You also need to add GraphViz to the PATH (environment variable) in Windows. Most likely, you can find GraphViz executable file at C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin. Once you found it, you need to set or change the PATH accordingly, adding GraphViz's location to it. For more details on how to do that, please refer to How to Add to Windows PATH Environment Variable.
